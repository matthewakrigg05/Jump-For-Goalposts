This is a project for my second year at university, the intention is to make a system for a football league.
So that it is easier for them to record statistics and match information. The main focus of this project is
to develop knowledge, understanding and application of Object-Oriented Programming, showcasing the use of the
OOP principles as well as building a functional UI.

There has been a stronger focus on the design phase of this project than there has been on my projects, involving diagrams and models such as use case models. These diagrams will be added to the repository once the project has been handed in and this repository is no longer something being worked on.
